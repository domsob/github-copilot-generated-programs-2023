# Given a string, return a list containing the number of words with n characters 
# for n from 1 to the length of the longest word.
# Additionally, return the number of sentences and the average sentence length.
# A word is any string of consecutive non-whitespace characters (including 
# sentence terminators). Every string will contain at least one sentence terminator 
# (period, exclamation point, or question mark). The average sentence length is 
# the number of words in the string divided by the number of sentence terminator characters.
