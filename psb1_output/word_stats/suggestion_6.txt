Suggestion 2

    """Return a list containing the number of words with n characters 
    for n from 1 to the length of the longest word.
    Additionally, return the number of sentences and the average sentence length.
    A word is any string of consecutive non-whitespace characters (including 
    sentence terminators). Every string will contain at least one sentence terminator 
    (period, exclamation point, or question mark). The average sentence length is 
    the number of words in the string divided by the number of sentence terminator characters.
